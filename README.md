<h1>Project Title</h1>

This App is the beginning of the Administration backend for my application.
I will be moving away from this once I have the initial data in the database and develop a front-end piece to be able to do the same functionality using the API.

The finished app will have an API backend using Flask and a React Front-end to deliver the data to the end-user.
